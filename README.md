# Mdk2VqTex

This is a utility that reads a texture from a .tex file and produces a PNG output.

This texture format is used in MDK2 game, a game of my childhood :3

To compile just use:
```
g++ -o main main.cpp -std=c++11
```

The code was generated by gemini 2.5 pro, I apologize for that, but this was possible after quite a long time of my exploration of the game's code in IDA :3 The issue was that IDA generated some REALLY obscured code, so don't think of me as a v*becoder (sorry for swearing), I just haven't got so many nerves to analyze the decompression code all by myself without using any tools :3
